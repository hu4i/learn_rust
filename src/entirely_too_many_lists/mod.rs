//! [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/) is a tutorial book 
//! focusing on some data structures (lists) with a non-authentic style. When trying to construct and refine your code and hearing
//! compiler's screaming, you will (probably) find that it is the smart and knowledgable rust comiler that is teaching you.
//! 
//! ## Keywords
//! 
//! * The following pointer types: `&`, `&mut`, `Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, `*const`, `*mut`, `NonNull`(?)
//! * Ownership, borrowing, inherited mutability, interior mutability, Copy
//! * All The Keywords: struct, enum, fn, pub, impl, use, ...
//! * Pattern matching, generics, destructors
//! * Testing, installing new toolchains, using `miri`
//! * Unsafe Rust: raw pointers, aliasing, stacked borrows, UnsafeCell, variance
